        <h2>Lisbon, Portugal</h2>
        <p>Lisbon was one of the most vibrant cities I visited. The city is built on seven hills, which means stunning views but also lots of walking on slipper stone (wear good shoes!) One of my favorite experiences was a sunset cruise on the Tagus River, where I got to see the city glow at golden hour. The food scene in Lisbon is incredible and affordable, with delicious pastel de natas and fresh seafood. The public transport is easy to navigate and well thoughts out. The culture and activities here are beyond enriching. This is a city I would never be bored in.</p>

        <h2>Amsterdam, Netherlands</h2>
        <p>Amsterdam had an amazing mix of history, nightlife, and chill energy. The canals, with their picturesque bridges and houseboats, made every street feel like a postcard. One of my favorite experiences was a canal boat tour at sunset, with a side of wine. Keep in mind, the biking culture is no joke. I didn’t rent one because I didn’t want to risk my life, but watch out when you're walking as well. The food scene was solid, though a lot of places had weird hours, so I’d recommend looking up places beforehand. If you visit Amsterdam, definitely explore beyond the city center, as there are cool local spots away from the crowds.</p>

        <h2>Morocco</h2>
        <p>Morocco was an experience like no other! I was a part of a Spanish student tour (I don't speak Spanish) that took me through the deserts, mountains, and cities of this incredible country. The camel ride at sunrise in the Sahara was one of the most surreal things I’ve ever done. That and the jeep ride through the dunes. The food here is incredible, but be weary of the water. Also be mindful the conservative dress norms. I opted for lightweight long sleeves and pants. Overall, Morocco was the most unique and exciting place I visited, and I’d absolutely reccomend it!</p>

        <h2>Ljubljana, Slovenia</h2>
        <p>Slovenia was the first stop of my 4 week solo trip and one of the biggest surprises of all my travels. Ljubljana, the capital, was small but so charming and welcoming. The city is super walkable, and the Ljubljanica River running through the center makes it look like something out of a fairy tale. But the real highlight was Lake Bled. I took a day tour from Ljubljana to Bled. The lake is surrounded by mountains, and you can swim in the crystal-clear water, rent a boat, or hike up to Bled Castle for insane views. I only spent two nights in Slovenia, and I wish I had more time. It is the kind of place where you just want to slow down and enjoy life. If you’re looking for a mix of relaxation and nature adventures, Slovenia is perfect.</p>

        <h2>Nice, France</h2>
        <p>Nice quickly became one of my favorite summer travel spots. It was just the right balance of beach and city. The Old Town is full of colorful buildings, cute cafés, and amazing food. The beaches are beautiful but all rocks (so mental prepare to relax and step on rocks). I took a day trip to Monaco, which was a quick train ride away and a great way to see the luxury life up close. I met a ton of other travelers at my hostel and spent the days with them. French people here were nicer than in Paris, but they definitely still stare. If you’re solo traveling, Nice is an amazing mix of fun, relaxation, and easy connections to other parts of France. But still maintain caution and awareness of your surroundings.</p>
