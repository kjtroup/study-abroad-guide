<!-- Austria (Innsbruck + Salzburg) -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <p>Here is just a look at my <a href="../destinations/destinations.html">favorite destinations</a></p>
        <h2>Austria</h2>
        <p><strong>Innsbruck:</strong> A true winter wonderland. Skiing here in the snowy Alps, crisp air, and that classic Austrian charm was unreal. The small resort I visited was perfect for beginners, and skiing was surprisingly affordable. It’s quieter than other European ski hubs, which made it even better.</p>
        <p><strong>Salzburg:</strong> Salzburg was a quick day trip with castles, old-world charm, and classic Austrian schnitzel. It rained the whole time, but exploring the Hohensalzburg Fortress was a highlight. If you visit, check the weather and bring an umbrella.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Malta</h2>
        <p>Malta was one of the most unique places I visited. The island’s history, architecture, and natural beauty made it a destination like no other. I stayed in St. Jullians Bay, which was gorgeous. Public transport was frustrating with buses being slow and unreliable, so I’d recommend renting a car or using Bolt taxis. One of the highlights was visiting Mdina, the “silent city,” which felt straight out of a movie.</p>

<!-- Slovakia (Bratislava) -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Bratislava, Slovakia</h2>
        <p>Super easy day trip from Vienna being just an hour away by train or bus. The Old Town is small but charming, and the traditional Slovak food is a must. If you visit on a Sunday, be aware that many things are closed. The city felt deserted.</p>

        <h2>Budapest, Hungary</h2>
        <p>Budapest was insanely beautiful at night. I did an unlimited prosecco boat cruise (10/10), explored ruin bars, and biked around the city. Trams are great, but I highly recommend renting a Lime scooter. This made getting around so fun.</p>

<!-- Netherlands (Amsterdam) -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Amsterdam, Netherlands</h2>
        <p>Amsterdam had an amazing mix of history, nightlife, and chill energy. The canals, with their picturesque bridges and houseboats, made every street feel like a postcard. One of my favorite experiences was a canal boat tour at sunset, with a side of wine. Keep in mind, the biking culture is no joke. I didn’t rent one because I didn’t want to risk my life, but watch out when you're walking as well. The food scene was solid, though a lot of places had weird hours, so I’d recommend looking up places beforehand. If you visit Amsterdam, definitely explore beyond the city center, as there are cool local spots away from the crowds.</p>

        <h2>Prague, Czech Republic</h2>
        <p>Prague was like a fairy tale. Colored buildings, charming bridges, and the best cheap beer in Europe. Rented a pedal boat on the river with my best friend, and it was one of the most fun random things I stumbled upon.</p>

<!-- Germany (Munich) -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Munich, Germany</h2>
        <p>Munich was a festival and football city for me. I went twice. Once for Springfest (a smaller, more local Oktoberfest in April) and once for a Euros football game. If you do Springfest or Oktoberfest, I highly recommend thrifting a dirndl stead of buying new. The beer gardens were iconic, the football energy was unmatched, and the metro was easy to navigate. Just be prepared to spend money. Beer festival steins are massive, but pricey. Munich is a must if you love Bavarian culture and good times.</p>

        <h2>Krakow, Poland</h2>
        <p>One of my most meaningful trips. I went to Auschwitz, and it was intense but incredibly eye opening. Krakow itself was a beautiful city and affordable. I recommend hitting a pierogi spot. I wish I had more time there.</p>

<!-- Portugal (Lisbon) -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Lisbon, Portugal</h2>
        <p>Lisbon was one of the most vibrant cities I visited. The city is built on seven hills, which means stunning views but also lots of walking on slipper stone (wear good shoes!) One of my favorite experiences was a sunset cruise on the Tagus River, where I got to see the city glow at golden hour. The food scene in Lisbon is incredible and affordable, with delicious pastel de natas and fresh seafood. The public transport is easy to navigate and well thoughts out. The culture and activities here are beyond enriching. This is a city I would never be bored in.</p>

        <h2>Albania</h2>
        <p>Albania was a beautiful and relaxing beach getaway. I spent time in Durres, which was chill and laid-back. The beach was great, but the public transport was not a thing. Cabs were the way to go and paid for by cash. Spent one night in Tirana as well and that was alright. The southern part of Albania is where the real hidden gems are. I didn’t make it there, but my friends did, and they raved about it. If I ever go back, I’m renting a car and heading south.</p>

<!-- Greece (Athens) -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Athens, Greece</h2>
        <p>Athens was sweltering but absolutely worth it. I also did a day boat trip to Aegina Island. It was pricey, but the food and the people made it 100% worth it. The Acropolis Pass is the best way to see everything historical, but go at 8 AM before the crowds hit. Greek food was amazing and inexpensive. My Airbnb was in a great location, and despite the heat, Athens had so much energy and history to take in.</p>

        <h2>Copenhagen, Denmark</h2>
        <p>Copenhagen was cold, rainy, and expensive but still such a cool place. I took an 8-euro canal boat tour, which was a great way to see the city. Also, took a train to Malmo, Sweden for a quick day trip. Be ready to spend money here. Food is super pricey, and even casual meals were around $20-30. The hostel I stayed at was amazing though—clean, friendly, and in a great location.</p>

<!-- Sweden (Malmo) -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Malmo, Sweden</h2>
        <p>A quick day trip from Copenhagen, Malmo was small but charming. I grabbed brunch, explored the city, and tried Swedish candy before heading back. It’s cheaper than Copenhagen, but still not a budget destination. Bird scooters were a fun and fast way to explore, and the train between the two cities made it an easy trip.</p>

        <h2>London, England</h2>
        <p>I was in London for barely 24 hours, so I didn’t do much sightseeing this time. But I still got matcha, explored Notting Hill, and hit Borough Market. It’s pricey, but I loved the vibe. British men? Annoying. If you’re American, just tell people you’re Canadian.</p>

<!-- Morocco -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Morocco</h2>
        <p>Morocco was an experience like no other! I was a part of a Spanish student tour (I don't speak Spanish) that took me through the deserts, mountains, and cities of this incredible country. The camel ride at sunrise in the Sahara was one of the most surreal things I’ve ever done. That and the jeep ride through the dunes. The food here is incredible, but be weary of the water. Also be mindful the conservative dress norms. I opted for lightweight long sleeves and pants. Overall, Morocco was the most unique and exciting place I visited, and I’d absolutely reccomend it!</p>

        <h2>Ljubljana, Slovenia</h2>
        <p>Slovenia was the first stop of my 4 week solo trip and one of the biggest surprises of all my travels. Ljubljana, the capital, was small but so charming and welcoming. The city is super walkable, and the Ljubljanica River running through the center makes it look like something out of a fairy tale. But the real highlight was Lake Bled. I took a day tour from Ljubljana to Bled. The lake is surrounded by mountains, and you can swim in the crystal-clear water, rent a boat, or hike up to Bled Castle for insane views. I only spent two nights in Slovenia, and I wish I had more time. It is the kind of place where you just want to slow down and enjoy life. If you’re looking for a mix of relaxation and nature adventures, Slovenia is perfect.</p>

<!-- Croatia -->
<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Croatia</h2>
        <p><strong>Split:</strong> A great mix of beaches and history. The Diocletian’s Palace was interesting. From here I took a day trip to Bosnia! The street food places were great too!</p>
        <p><strong>Dubrovnik:</strong> Game of Thrones fans, this is your place. The Old Town is stunning, but honestly? I loved the beaches and relaxing aspects of Dubrovnik. My favorite expeerience was a Wine and Zipline sunset tour! Also did a day tour to Montenegro.</p>

        <h2>Bosnia & Herzegovina</h2>
        <p>Mostar was an incredibly underrated city with amazing food. The Stari Most bridge was beautiful, and the history here is deep. The contrast between Ottoman-style buildings and the scars of war make this place so unique. Bosnia is affordable, welcoming, and a great escape from crowded European tourist spots. I highly recommend adding it to your itinerary. Kravice Falls was a great way to cool off too!</p>

        <p>Montenegro was a quick but beautiful stop. Kotor was the highlight with stunning views, a charming old town, and fresh seafood. Then we took a boat to Perast. If you’re visiting Croatia, a day trip to Kotor is totally worth it. Just be prepared for border crossing delays.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <h2>France</h2>
        <p><strong>Toulouse:</strong> My mid-solo travel chill trip to visit a friend. Toulouse is an amazing little city, and I wouldn’t have thought to visit if my friend didn’t live there, but I loved it. We just hung out, explored, and soaked in the city. The pub/bar culture here is fun, and pastries, cheese, and beer from grocery stores were elite.</p>
        <p><strong>Nice:</strong> This quickly became one of my favorite summer travel spots. It was just the right balance of beach and city. The Old Town is full of colorful buildings, cute cafés, and amazing food. The beaches are beautiful but all rocks (so mental prepare to relax and step on rocks). I took a day trip to Monaco, which was a quick train ride away and a great way to see the luxury life up close. I met a ton of other travelers at my hostel and spent the days with them. French people here were nicer than in Paris, but they definitely still stare. If you’re solo traveling, Nice is an amazing mix of fun, relaxation, and easy connections to other parts of France. But still maintain caution and awareness of your surroundings.</p>

<div class="two-column">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Monaco</h2>
        <p>A quick day trip from Nice. Monaco was glamorous, expensive, and so polished it felt surreal. I spent about five hours here exploring the harbor, the F1 circut, and some incredible viewpoints. The city is walkable, but the streets feel maze-like because of all the elevators and hills. It started raining while I was there. A great half-day trip, but I wouldn’t stay overnight.</p>

        <p>Mallorca was a beach paradise! Cliffside views, turquoise water, and peaceful coves.. It was the perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. I went on a catamaran lunch boat tour, met another solo traveler, and spent the day swimming in crystal-clear waters. Renting a car would be the best way to explore, but the buses work if you're patient. I stayed in a nice hostel with AC and met cool people, but this would be an even better trip with friends.</p>

        <h2>Italy</h2>
        <p><strong>Milan:</strong> This was mostly just a layover stop, but I did a quick visit to the art district, the Duomo, and grabbed some amazing sandwiches. The airport connections to the city were easy, but watch for pickpockets.</p>
        <p><strong>Cinque Terre:</strong> Hands down one of the most stunning places I’ve ever seen. The colorful villages, coastal cliffs, and hiking trails made it one of my top Italian destinations. I recommend staying in La Spezia instead of the villages themselves for a better price.</p>
        <p><strong>Florence:</strong> Romantic, artistic, and beautiful. By this point in my travels, I was burning out, so I didn’t do much sightseeing. But the food, wine, and just wandering around the city made this a great stop. Super touristy, so watch out for pickpockets.</p>
        <p><strong>Rome:</strong> My final stop after six months of travel. I was tired but still took in the Trevi Fountain, the Colosseum, and street performances at Ponte Sisto. The public transit isn’t great, so I mostly walked everywhere. Rome is crowded but magical at night.</p>
